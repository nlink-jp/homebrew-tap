  # The tool MUST answer `--version`, not only a `version` subcommand: without
  # the flag it exits non-zero, `shell_output` raises, and `brew test` fails —
  # while `brew install` still succeeds, so the breakage only surfaces once the
  # tool is in the tap. With cobra, `rootCmd.Version = Version` provides the
  # flag; keep its output identical to the subcommand's and pin both in a test.
